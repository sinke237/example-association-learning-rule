# Data mining and machine learning algorithms

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of data mining and machine
learning algorithms implemented in Python. You should
_fork_ it and implement them. You can use the [notebook](./notebook)
to test your implementation.

## Learning

This repo is to test if you can do verified commits and pull requests. You can learn the topics in the following links:

- https://withblue.ink/2020/05/17/how-and-why-to-sign-git-commits.html
- https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification

Next is a small competition.

1. Learning only:
    - Fork this repository
    - Clone your forked repository
    - Write some code
    - Commit your changes
    - Push your changes to your forked repository
    - Verify your commits are signed
    - You're done ðŸ˜„!

2. Competition Guidelines:
   The winner is getting something from Stephane and Armand.

   The competition is to implement the apriori algorithm. The first one to implement it and make a pull request will be
   the winner. The winner will be announced in the next class.

    1. Fork this repository
    2. Clone your forked repository
    3. Create a new branch
    4. Add your code
    5. Commit your changes
    6. Push your changes to your forked repository
    7. Create a pull request
    8. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed
    9. Merge the pull request

## Association rules

To implement the apriori algorithm, you need to implement the following functions:

1. Firstly [support.py](./src/support.py)

- Doc [here](./docs/support.md)
- Demo [here](./notebook/support.ipynb)

2. Secondly [confidence.py](./src/confidence.py)

- Doc [here](./docs/confidence.md)
- Demo [here](./notebook/confidence.ipynb)

3. Lastly [apriori.py](./src/apriori.py)

- Doc [here](./docs/apriori.md)
- Demo [here](./notebook/apriori.ipynb)
